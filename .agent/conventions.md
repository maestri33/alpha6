# Alpha6 Brand & Operations Conventions

## Core Philosophy
- **Identity**: Always write and design as **"one who structures and operates"** (quem estrutura e opera).
- **Tone**: Professional, tactical, and execution-oriented.
- **Avoid**: Never write as **"one who sells promises"** (quem vende promessa). Avoid marketing superlatives, vague claims, or "dream-selling" language.

## Design Principles
- Focus on clarity of operations.
- Highlight metrics, methods, and tangible infrastructure.
- Visuals should reflect reliability, engineering, and technological robustness.
